This program reads a CSV file containing reviews and ratings, processes the reviews to extract useful information, 
and saves the processed data to a new CSV file. It also generates a word cloud of the top 50 words used in the reviews 
and a bar plot of the common parts of speech (POS) tags found in the reviews.
